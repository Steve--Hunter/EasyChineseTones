# Actions on Google: Trivia Game using Node.js

The Trivia Game lets users play an interactive game with various personas. Includes classic game show sounds and humor, for a touch of nostalgia.

You can also try out a hosted version of this game at [https://triviatemplate.com/](https://triviatemplate.com/).

## Setup Instructions

### Steps
1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing.
1. Under *Build a custom app*, click *BUILD* in the Dialogflow box and then click *Create Actions on Dialogflow*.
1. Click *Save* to save the project.
1. Click on the gear icon to see the project settings.
1. Select *Export and Import*.
1. Select *Restore from zip*. Follow the directions to restore from the `TriviaGame.zip` file in this repo.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the `functions` folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) and the static resources needed by the project using [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/):
    1. Follow the instructions to [install the Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart#install-the-firebase-cli).
    1. Run `firebase init`, and select to configure `Hosting` and `Functions`. Select the project you've previously created in the Actions on Google Console as default project. In the configuration wizard, accept all the default choices (I say no to ESlint, seems to avoid problems later - if it throws an an error, delete the lint section from firebase.json). If re-installing, need to delete the .firebasesrc file.
    1. Edit the database data with questions (questions.json) and prompts (prompts.json). Generate a private key using Firebase Settings/Service Accounts (download the JSON cert file generated to the functions folder), and edit `functions/database.js` with the:
      - path to the JSON cert file.
      - database name databaseURL:, from Firebase - Project Settings - Service Accounts (Node.js option)
       Now populate the database: `node database.js` (may need to update to the latest firebase-functions SDK by running "npm i --save firebase-functions@latest" inside your functions folder). Operation is successful when 'Database updated' is displayed, the command will keep updating, to quit type ctrl-C (note: need to run command in the \functions folder, and have the .json file there)
    1. Run `firebase deploy` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL (triviaGame): https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/triviaGame`. The command will also deploy the static assets at `https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/`.
1. Go back to the Dialogflow console and select *Fulfillment* from the left navigation menu. Enable *Webhook*, set the value of *URL* to the `Function URL` from the previous step, then click *Save*.
1. Select *Integrations* from the left navigation menu and open the *Settings* menu for Actions on Google.
1. Click *Test*
1. Click *View* to open the Actions on Google simulator.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.  *Note*, if testing multiple Google Actions, only *one* can be the test app - find the one that is currently chosen, and disable testing (click on the device icon in the web simulator)
